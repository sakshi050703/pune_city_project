                        Pune stands at the top in rankings as the most livable city in India for 2018. This reputation of Pune has gradually grown over the years. The last decade has seen Pune bloom like never before. Owing to its great weather and proximity to Mumbai, Pune has become a sought after destination. Many big companies have set up base here in Pune realizing the potential of growth in this city. Consequently, Pune has become one of the biggest IT hubs in India. Pune consists of many big and small IT Tech Parks with world-class facilities. Let’s take a look at the top IT Parks in Pune.

                    <p>
                        Hinjawadi was completely a rural locale until the construction of the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park (RGIP) in mid 1990s. Since its advent, thishas been the biggest and fastest developing IT Hub of Pune. RGIP lies about 20 kms towardsthe West of Pune and is a 25-minute to an hour’s drive from the city. RGIP houses many big and small IT/ITES companies and few non-IT companies employing more than 3,00,000 employees.
                        The IT Park currently comprises three phases with future expansions planned in a total of about 700 hectors of MIDC area.<br>
                        RGIP has over 150 industries and despite the name indicating an IT Park, there are manufacturing, pharmaceutical, R&D hubs and other non-IT companies located within RGIP. To enable a better work life balance for the employees, MIDC also has numerous plots earmarked for residential societies, educational centres, bus depots, shopping centres, post offices and other administrative infrastructure necessary to run a mini-township. Many of these are fully ready and functioning, and few are under construction.

A significant node and the first Special Economic Zone (SEZ) of Pune is located in Kharadi and spans a total area of ~ 6.2 million sq. ft. across Phase I & II. The campus spreads across ~57 acres and is the most prestigious IT destination within Pune's Eastern Corridor.<br>
                       EON Free Zone Phase I & II, with its innovative design, brings freedom-work culture alive. Phase I has a total built-up area of ~ 4 million sq. ft. and consists of interconnected five clusters, namely A, B, C, D and E. These clusters are well equipped with an array of amenities, making it more than a workplace. Eon Free Zone I is a foundation for the convergence of people, ideas, business, innovation and intelligence to create a thoughtful community. Eon Free Zone Phase II is built on the same principles, ideologies and pioneering qualities of Phase I.
